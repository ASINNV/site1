#My Thoughts On Site1

##THE GOOD

I think it went very well considering it was my second website attempt while following orders. The finished product turned out nearly identical to the mockup and I only reached a few snags which were quickly overcome with the help of precious google and my teacher/brother. No backend work had to be done so that improved my work ethic, seeing as how I don't know too much about the workings behind websites yet, just a touch of JavaScript, I could have been daunted quite easily. I have came out of this project with a reawakened love for the little stuff, the easy work of coding, and have gained an intense feeling of excitement for what the future holds. New, as well as familiar, techniques and tools have been brushed up and learned and I greatly look forward to my next project. I plan to cut down operation time by as much as I can next time.

##THE NOT SO GOOD

Of the few snags I met, some were quick and painless with the help of my brother. However, I need a good lesson in good habits. The art of correctness all the way through. I tend to think about just the first task and not the webpage as a whole (sometimes I take a wholistic view, but I often forget) and it always gets me in a rut further down the road. I did this today. I jumped in, made a snap judgment of what I wanted to do first and then took off, finding myself twisted and tied up, having to make less efficient workarounds or fixes, there from my previous laziness, to problems that really didn't need to be there. I hope I can make a change soon and swiftly because I can feel the bad habit forming. I know I can change it, I just have to be fully conscious when sitting down to work. 

##WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY

I would go slowly in the beginning, putting together my mental image of how I want to go about things. I would find elements that go together and group them, implementing from top to bottom with great attention to detail. I will sit on each move and think, is this the best way of going about this? Will this lead to any future freezes? If so, I will find another way, if I cannot, I will ask questions. This shouldn't slow me down much. If it takes too long, I will move on or work on another part that won't affect my current quandary. I will also follow the mockup to the tee from the very beginning. This last project ended up taking much more time than was necessary because I had just used filler colors, sizes and fonts before coming back to them at the end and fixing it. Basically, I entered a ton of information twice without reason. This will be an easy way to cut down my time spent coding for one project.

##ALL IN ALL

All in all it was a very fun and capturing experience. I became quite engrossed with the work and could definitely see myself following this career path. I believe I did more right than wrong with this assignment but there was definitely room for improvement. I look forward to doing just that, improving.
